# Store Theme

Store Theme is a boilerplate theme based on the VTEX IO Store Framework with **pre-configured blocks and templates for store's front**.

The theme's default configurations will allow you to work in a **swift** and **easy** way, avoiding the need to build your store's front from scratch. If you want to build without these pre-configurations, you should access the [Minimum Boilerplate Theme](https://github.com/vtex-apps/minimum-boilerplate-theme/pull/1)repository and follow the indicated steps. 

Once the Store Theme is a boilerplate theme, it includes all default blocks any store's front could ask for, such as:

- [Footer](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.store-footer/)

Notice: **all Store Framework store blocks are open source**, including those imported by Store Theme. Production ready, you can contribute to developing these apps by simply accessing their documentation in this Github organization (`vtex-apps`).
